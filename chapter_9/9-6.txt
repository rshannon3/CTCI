9.6 Sales Rank: A large eCommerce company wishes to list the best-selling products, overall and by category. For example, one product might be the #1056th best-selling product overall but the #13th best-selling product under "Sports Equipment" and the #24th best-selling product under "Safety." Describe how you would design this system. Hints:#142, #158, #176, #189, #208, #223, #236, #244

Firstly, we can store every every unique product in a database. Each record will have a unique ID, the number of sales, and a set of identifiers for which categories it falls under. This way, if we wanted to view the top selling items under a category, we can simply select all items under that category and sort them by sales. We can store this information in a new table using something like “SELECT INTO” and then use these tables on the site to show the top item of each category. We can easily add new new tables as categories are added or create more specific rankings like best selling items that match a set of multiple categories.
